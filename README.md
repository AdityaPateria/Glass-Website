# Glass UI Gaming Dashboard

This project is a gaming dashboard with a modern **glassmorphism** UI design. The dashboard features a user profile section and a display of active games with their progress. The design includes a translucent, frosted glass effect, clean typography, and a minimal color scheme, making it visually appealing and responsive across devices.

## Features

- **Glassmorphism UI**: The website uses glassmorphism, giving elements a blurred, semi-transparent background with a frosted glass effect.
- **Profile Section**: Displays the userâ€™s avatar, name, and membership status.
- **Active Games List**: A list of currently played games along with progress bars.
- **Sidebar Navigation**: Easy navigation with icons for streams, games, new releases, and library sections.
- **Responsive Design**: Adjusts to different screen sizes for a seamless experience across devices.
- **PS5 Game Version Display**: Each game displays its progress and version (PS5 in this case).
  
## Tech Stack

- **HTML5**: Structuring the web content.
- **CSS3**: For styling and implementing the glassmorphism effect using `backdrop-filter` and `box-shadow`.
- **Flexbox/Grid**: Ensures proper layout and responsiveness of elements.
